# student-stat-table

To provide a detailed introduction, I will assume that you are referring to the student statistics project discussed earlier, which was developed in Java and uses object-oriented programming to process student data, including their names, grades, and corresponding subjects. Here is an overview of the project:

Project Purpose:
The goal of this project is to create a system that can store, process, and display student performance data. By using Java's object-oriented programming techniques, such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes, the system can effectively organize data and provide useful statistical information, such as students' total scores, average scores, and print all subject scores for each student.

# Main components and functions:

Data structure:
Student information: Use Map<String, Integer> to store subject names and corresponding grades, where the key is the subject name and the value is the grade.

Student class: Each student object contains name and grade data.

Class design:
Statistics interface: defines the statistical functions that must be implemented, such as calculating average and total scores.

AbstractStudentStats abstract class: implements the basic functions of the Statistics interface and provides some abstract methods for subclasses to implement, such as the method for calculating average scores.
StudentStats class: inherited from AbstractStudentStats, implements all abstract methods, and provides the function of printing student names, subjects, and grades.

Function implementation:
Calculate total score: traverse the student's grade data and calculate the total score.
Calculate average score: calculate the average score based on the grade data.
Print grades: print each student's subject and corresponding grade.

Technical details:
Java Collections Framework: HashMap in the Java collection framework is used to store and manage student grade data.
Object-oriented design principles: The project demonstrates the core principles of object-oriented design, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism through inheritance and interfaces.

Usage scenarios:
This system can be used by schools to manage student grades, help teachers quickly obtain student performance, and perform necessary statistical analysis. It can also be used as part of educational software to help students and parents track their learning progress.

Scalability and maintainability:
Scalability: New features can be easily added, such as adding different types of statistical analysis or supporting different grades input formats.
Maintainability: Due to the use of modular design and object-oriented principles, the system is easy to maintain and update.
This project demonstrates how to handle complex data through an object-oriented approach and provides practical tools to support educational activities.

none-used class:The graduate Student class is not used. It is used as a backup inheritance class if future projects require adding GraduateStudent to the statistical table and have different calculation algorithms.
